# mass-jpg-to-png
Converts all .jpg files in a folder to .png and pastes them in a new folder

HOW TO USE:-

Put all original images in a folder in the same directory as .py file

[For example, let's say the original folder is called "from"]

Run converter.py as:- python converter.py "from" "to"

If "to" folder [just an example name] does not exist, it will be created in the same directory as .py and "from"

All .jpg files from "from" will be converted to .png and pasted in "to"

Original files will remain intact

PLEASE MAKE SURE ALL FOLDERS ARE IN SAME DIRECTORY AS .PY FILE

Non-jpg files in "from" will be ignored

Names will be retained ["abcd.jpg" becomes "abcd.png"]


THIS IS A SIMPLE HOME PROJECT
